## Troubleshooting
Migration Issues
Problem: When running migrations, you might encounter errors indicating the target database is not up to date.
Solution:
Ensure all previous migrations are applied by running:
bash
**Copy** code
pipenv run alembic upgrade head

If you see the error persists, check the current migration state:

bash
**Copy** code
pipenv run alembic current
If necessary, you can drop the alembic_version table in the SQLite database and regenerate the initial migration:
sql
**Copy** code
sqlite3 enrollment.db
DROP TABLE alembic_version;
